# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world!

I recently graduated from Columbia University with a degree in CS
science where I mainly studied software systems. I'm a big fan of 
open-source software and when I'm not kernel hacking, I maintain a few
small projects on GitHub, like [this framework](https://github.com/rdnajac/cbmf) 
for genomic data analysis. I like figuring out how things work and 
sharing what I learn with others, so I'm also writing a 
[how-to guide](https://palomerolab.github.io/how-to/)
for computational biology in high performance computing environments.
