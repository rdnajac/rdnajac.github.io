# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world!

I'm a Columbia University graduate with a degree in CS specializing in operating
systems and software architecture. I'm a big fan of open-source software and
when I'm not kernel hacking, I maintain a few small projects on GitHub,
like [this framework](https://github.com/rdnajac/cbmf) for genomic data
analysis and my current lab's [website](https://palomerolab.github.io/).

I like figuring out how things work and sharing what I learn with others,
so I'm also writing a [how-to guide](https://palomerolab.github.io/how-to/)
for running bioinformatics tools and pipelines in high performance computing
environments with a focus on reproducibility and scalability.
